#### Description:
Pointer App is a web application developed as the final project for the CS50 Course. The application enables users to create accounts and add points to the map. Users can include additional data (key-value pairs) for each point. The primary objective of the app is to streamline the process of field surveys by allowing users to plan observation points in the office and input necessary data during fieldwork directly from their devices (the web application is adapted for mobile screens). All data is stored in the database, and the app maintains a comprehensive history log for each point. This feature enables users to access previous versions of points on the map, facilitating recurring observations and ensuring data accuracy. The application also allows users to import the data from GeoJSON files and export their points to GeoJSON as well.

#### Technologies Used:
